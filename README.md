## 👨‍💻 About Me

Software Engineer & Technical Leader with **8+ years of experience in Software Development**, passionate about designing, building, and **scaling reliable, high-traffic backend systems**, primarily in **financial technology**.

I specialize in:

- **Backend & distributed systems**
- **Scalability, reliability, & system design**
- **Engineering leadership & technical mentorship**

I’ve led engineering teams from **small squads to groups of 40+ engineers**,
helping build **maintainable, scalable system**s** and deliver consistently as teams grow.

## 📈 Continuous Learning

I actively invest in **structured learning** to sharpen both **hands-on engineering skills** and **architectural thinking**, including:

- **Fullstack JavaScript Engineering — [Hacktiv8](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l0SsClyJt0VtWKm_HnFPS2Di77o2jrZa/view)**  
  Strengthened end-to-end system understanding, from frontend architecture to backend integration.

- **TOGAF Architecture Training — PROXIS**  
  Deepened perspective on **enterprise architecture**, **system boundaries**, and **long-term technology planning**.

I believe strong engineers keep learning — not to chase trends, but to **build better systems and make better decisions**.

## 📘 Engineering Handbooks

This GitHub serves as a **long-term engineering knowledge base** -  
a **production-oriented handbook** focused on **what to build** and **how to build it**  
in **real-world backend and distributed systems**.

### 📂 Current Handbooks (In Progress)

- **handbook-go**  
  Go fundamentals, concurrency model, backend patterns, and system design practices.

- **handbook-java**  
  Java fundamentals, JVM internals, enterprise architecture, scalability, and reliability.

### 🎯 Objectives

- Canonical reference for backend engineers
- Clear progression from **fundamentals → advanced concepts**
- Emphasis on **trade-offs, design decisions, and production realities**
- Language-specific, but **system-thinking driven**

### 📚 Content Structure

- Core concepts
- Architectural & design patterns
- Best practices & anti-patterns
- Practical, production-inspired examples
- (Optional) Internal-style engineering playbooks
